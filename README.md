binext.py is a Python module for operating on binary extension fields, GF(2^m)

Provides classes for creating and operating in finite fields:

/class/ ff: general finite field, generates and stores tables for translating between power and vector representations in GF(2^m)
  
  Also provides method for printing out table of minimum polynomials, in same format as Lin and Costello book
